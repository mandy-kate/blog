              <div class="textblock-leftalign">I'm interested in leadership and what that looks like today compared to what it looked like in the past and what it might look like in the future.
                <br>
                <br> Digital and data have been identified as key government priority areas that are imperative for future service delivery. I am interested in: what is the relationship between digital, data and leadership? Because isn't a digital strategy just as much about people as it is technology?
                <br>
                <br>In “Predictions for 2017: Everything is Becoming Digital” Bersin by Deloitte observes there has been a shift in the skills required of leaders, as the knowledge and experience needed to implement digital projects (mobile design, analytics, online experience strategies) goes well beyond the capacity for one or two ‘tech-savy’ people. And we hear themes at recent NZ tech conference Webstock that suggest “everyone is a designer” and encourages organisations to infuse design principles into every team.
                <br>
                <br> Conversation with leaders say that projects won’t fail because of a lack of technical ability, but will fail because of communication breakdown or misaligned expectations. In other words, a project will only ever be as good as the clear and meaningful communication between the people involved in its design and implementation.
                <br>
                <br> The question then becomes, which leaders (and I mean ‘leaders’ in a non-hierarchical sense too) are working well together? What skills and behaviors do they demonstrate (and value)? Are their stories being shared widely enough to include others?
                <br>
                <br> In a service delivery environment is the role of the leader to encourage others to learn about new ways of working and be in a position to understand impact? Is it about working with people so they can be prepared of the changes instead of being pulled (or pushed) along by them?
                <br>
                <br> There is another element to this: senior, respected and intelligent decision makers are realising that their work programme has a higher chance of success if they go to someone potentially thirty years their junior and say “show me how”. This isn’t how leadership has typically worked, and is challenging traditional views. But instead of creating a divide there’s a story to tell.</div>
