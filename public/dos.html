              <div class="textblock-leftalign">In terms of global governance, the New Zealand government can be seen to be at the forefront of developing a strong digital service for all New Zealanders. NZ is part of an international government digital partnership, which includes Estonia, Israel, South Korea and the United Kingdom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_5">(known as Digital 5 or D5)</a>, and new cross-agency <a href="https://www.ipanz.org.nz/Event?Action=View&Event_id=574">life event projects</a> are being recognised and rewarded as best practice<br>

                <br>Agencies need the technical infrastructure to be in place in order to deliver more responsive online services at the right time to the right people. However, research suggests that an equally important factor is leadership and management mindset.
                <br>

                <br> Instead of having all the answers (traditional view), leadership is about looking for opportunities to question the status quo and gain alternative perspectives.
                <br>

                <br>Organisations look to move toward a more digital operating model - and this change is happening in planned and unplanned ways. For example, following the November 2016 earthquake, Customs NZ's head office in Wellington was relocated to a new building. The new building had fewer printers and, as a result, some teams are now using 70 per cent less paper. This change aligns with the organisation's digital strategy but was not part of a detailed plan.<br>

                <br> Authors of Sense and Respond Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden suggest that instead of having to immediately come up with all the answers, asking the right questions is a better way for leaders to unlock the innovation process, make change and shift mindsets. Gothelf and Seiden go further and suggest that leaders who tend to use industrial-age management approaches on digital-age problems may miss opportunities to achieve their anticipated results (Gothelf and Seiden 2016).
                <br>

                <br>Cross-agency collaboration is increasingly relevant. What we see is that trust is fundamental when working with people from different backgrounds to pilot something new – people won’t incorporate changes or take on new ideas without trusting those who are involved in the design and implementation.
                <br>

                <br>Public sector leaders are faced with new levels of complexity, uncertainty and opportunity in their work. If you understand what your customers are trying to do, you can probably find a way to create a valuable service for them – technology allows new ways to do this.
                <br>

                <br>To deal with uncertainty, we see people adopt an approach that is oriented toward learning and making small steps continuously in the right direction. This approach, which was pioneered in the software world, is increasingly relevant across organisations outside of the tech sector because many operations are now tied in one way or another to online service delivery.
                <br>

                <br>The industrial-age approach to managing uncertainty was to develop detailed plans, but detailed plans can break down in the face of reality because of a series of unknowns. A clear but flexible plan can allow unplanned opportunities to be maximised.
